The $y$-axis indicates the number of points in the training set. The step size used for the above was 0.01, on $[0, 1]$ normalized input images. Note that for training points belonging to class ``1", it takes not more than 10 steps in these adversarial paths. This means that for an attack radius of $\epsilon =0.1$, almost the entire class must be vulnerable, which is indeed the case. The adversarial accuracy of the model trained on the clean dataset, on targeted attacks from 1 to 2 is 0.\relax }{figure.caption.22}{}}
